# gp-commitment-calculator

I work in a team that constantly needs to calculate what amount represents 1% of a investment fund
It's not a hard calculation, but I wanter an easier way to have that done

First project was done fully in python and published in Replit
After learning a little more on frontend, I made a second version more user-friendly

Hope it's useful!
